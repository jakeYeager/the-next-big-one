## Prompt Text
**Original Query:**
```
Is there any published research that relates mass investor behavior (i.e. boom, bust market cycles) to the progression of an individual into criminal activity, from the perspective of criminal justice psychology? That is, are there similarities in the phases and cognitive mechanisms that lead an individual into criminal activity similar to the pattern of behavior in market participants (group), which lead to market collapse?
```

## Session Summary
This session involved research into the intersection of criminal psychology progression patterns and collective market behavior. The query sought published research connecting:

1. Individual criminal development stages/phases
2. Mass investor behavior in boom-bust cycles  
3. Cognitive mechanisms underlying both phenomena
4. Potential parallels between individual criminal progression and collective market psychology

The research approach involved multiple web searches across criminal psychology, behavioral finance, social learning theory, and behavioral contagion literature to identify potential theoretical connections between these domains.
