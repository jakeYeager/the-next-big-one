## Chat Prompt History

### Initial Query
**User**: "I like report type artifacts to have the version under the header with the current date. I like reports to have citations where possible, and unique content that is paraphrased or derived should use terms like 'extrapolated' and 'compiled'. I really like these two phase documents however I suspect that the regulatory cycle phases are more well recognized in academic circles. Can you research the 'legal fraud' phases and provide citations if it is also a well know phase structure?"

### Follow-up Prompts
1. **Academic Recognition Research**: Request for comparison between regulatory cycle phases and legal fraud phases academic recognition
2. **Regulatory Cycle Enhancement**: "Can you please clean up the regulatory cycle phases document and provide references and citations?"
3. **Contemporary Examples**: "Can you please make a new version of the regulatory phases document expanding Phase 4 to include some deregulation examples from the Biden and Trump administrations?"
4. **Consumer Protection Analysis**: "Can you also include the activity of DOGE in removing consumer protections?"
5. **Legislative Analysis**: "Are there any deregulatory provisions in One Big Beautiful Bill Act that could be added to Phase 4?"
6. **Historical Context**: "Can you please expand the Phase 1: Historical Examples with a short description of what each act was supposed to address?"
7. **AI Regulation**: "Can you expand Phase 4 with AI deregulation examples?"
8. **Specific Detail**: "Who was the single senate vote for the keeping the 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating AI?"
9. **Meta-Documentation**: "Can you create a 'prompt log' for this chat and project that includes: project name, project instructions, a listing of any project files, this chat's prompt text, prompt date & time, and the Claude AI version."

## Project Instructions Summary
- Reports should include version numbers and current dates in headers
- Citations required where possible
- Use terms like "extrapolated" and "compiled" for derived content
- Focus on academic credibility and proper sourcing
- Emphasis on regulatory cycle analysis with contemporary examples
- Integration of behavioral psychology and cognitive bias frameworks
- Real-time analysis of current deregulatory trends (2025 focus)

## Key Analytical Focus Areas
1. **Regulatory Cycle Theory**: 20-30 year patterns in financial regulation
2. **Legal Fraud Framework**: Novel synthesis of existing academic concepts
3. **Contemporary Application**: Current Trump administration deregulation (2025)
4. **Behavioral Psychology**: Cognitive mechanisms enabling market participant complicity
5. **Historical Precedent**: Pattern recognition across multiple financial crises
