# Regulatory Cycle Phases

## The 20-30 Year Regulatory Pattern

Academic research has documented a consistent pattern of financial regulatory cycles spanning 20-30 years, characterized by five distinct phases. This framework is extrapolated from empirical analysis of ten major financial crises since the 18th century and represents a fundamental feature of democratic capitalism's approach to financial regulation.

## Phase 1: Post-Crisis Re-regulation (2-5 years)

**Characteristics:**
- Immediate political response to financial crisis
- Broad consensus for strict regulatory rules
- "Never again" mentality dominates policy discourse
- Rapid legislative action to restore market confidence

**Theoretical Foundation:**
Dagher (2018) notes that "the regulatory backlash that ensues from financial crises can only be understood in the context of the deep political ramifications of these crises", as financial crises typically trigger immediate political turnover and policy responses.

**Historical Examples:**
- **Glass-Steagall Act (1933)**: Enacted 4 years after the 1929 stock market crash to separate commercial and investment banking, prevent banks from using depositor funds for securities speculation, and establish federal deposit insurance to restore public confidence in the banking system
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002)**: Passed 1 year after the Enron collapse to address corporate accounting fraud by mandating CEO/CFO certification of financial statements, establishing stronger auditor independence requirements, and creating the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to regulate auditing firms
- **Dodd-Frank Act (2010)**: Implemented 2 years after the 2008 financial crisis to address "too big to fail" institutions through enhanced capital requirements, create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to prevent predatory lending, and regulate derivatives markets that had contributed to systemic risk

**Duration Pattern:**
Post-crisis re-regulation typically occurs within 2-5 years of the triggering crisis, with the speed depending on the severity of political and economic disruption.

## Phase 2: Regulatory Stability (5-10 years)

**Characteristics:**
- New rules mature and become institutionalized
- Memory of the precipitating crisis remains fresh among policymakers
- Compliance costs accepted as necessary for financial stability
- Political consensus maintains regulatory framework

**Academic Insight:**
This phase represents the period when regulatory frameworks become embedded in institutional practices before "electoral concerns" begin to influence policy toward pro-cyclical changes.

**Duration Pattern:**
Stability phases typically last 5-10 years post-enactment, ending when crisis memory fades among policymakers and a new generation of political leaders emerges without direct experience of the precipitating crisis.

## Phase 3: Gradual Erosion (5-10 years)

**Characteristics:**
- Industry lobbying efforts intensify against existing regulations
- "Modernization" and "competitiveness" arguments gain political traction
- Regulatory capture increases through revolving door appointments
- Incremental loosening begins through enforcement changes and interpretive guidance

**Key Academic Finding:**
"Post-crisis regulations do not always survive the following boom" as regulations erode through non-enforcement, regulatory loopholes, and institutional capture rather than formal legislative repeal (Dagher, 2018).

**Mechanism:**
Research shows this erosion occurs when "competent politicians take regulatory risks to signal their competence" in response to changing public opinion about financial innovation (Almasi, Dagher, & Prato, 2025).

## Phase 4: Active Deregulation (3-7 years)

**Characteristics:**
- Major legislative changes removing regulatory constraints
- Political momentum builds around "innovation" and "economic growth"
- Rapid expansion in dubious financial products exploiting regulatory gaps
- "This time is different" mentality dominates policy discourse

**Historical Pattern:**
Empirical analysis shows that "financial booms—and risk-taking during these episodes—were often amplified by political regulatory stimuli, credit subsidies, and an increasing light-touch approach to financial supervision".

**Contemporary Examples (2017-2025):**

*Trump Administration (2017-2021):*
- **Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (2018)**: Raised the threshold for "systemically important" banks from $50 billion to $250 billion in assets, exempting 25 of the 38 largest U.S. banks from enhanced regulatory oversight
- **Executive Orders on Financial Regulation**: Targeted Dodd-Frank as a "disastrous policy," with executive orders scaling back the 2010 financial regulatory framework and instructing agencies to review existing rules
- **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Weakening**: Systematic efforts to reduce CFPB enforcement capabilities and change leadership structure

*Biden Administration (2021-2025):*
- **Cryptocurrency Guidance Reversal**: Initially issued 2022 guidance directing plan fiduciaries to exercise "extreme care" before adding cryptocurrency to 401(k) plans, which was later rescinded by the Trump administration in 2025
- **Continued Dodd-Frank Erosion**: Limited reversal of Trump-era deregulation despite Democratic control

*Trump Administration (2025-Present):*
- **401(k) Alternative Assets Executive Order (August 2025)**: Signed executive order allowing 401(k) retirement accounts to invest in "higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments," potentially giving financial players access to "a pool of funds worth trillions"
- **Cryptocurrency Deregulation**: Rescinded Biden-era guidance that warned of "significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss" associated with cryptocurrency investments in retirement accounts
- **Private Market Access**: Directed Department of Labor to review fiduciary guidance on private market investments, facilitating access to previously restricted asset classes for retail investors
- **DOGE Consumer Protection Dismantling**: Department of Government Efficiency systematically targeting consumer protection agencies, with Musk posting "CFPB RIP" and "Delete CFPB" while moving to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has returned over $21 billion to defrauded consumers since 2010
- **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (July 2025)**: Comprehensive deregulatory legislation that reduced the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding cap, allocated $100 million to OMB for "improving regulatory processes and analyzing and reviewing rules," streamlined permits for fossil fuel projects, and created what critics described as a "slush fund for Trump administration overreach" while cutting over $1.2 trillion in federal spending primarily from low-income programs. Originally included a sweeping 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation that was ultimately removed by a 99-1 Senate vote
- **AI Deregulation Initiative (January-July 2025)**: Comprehensive dismantling of Biden-era AI oversight through Executive Order "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," rescinding Biden's AI safety framework and replacing it with "a framework centered on deregulation and the promotion of AI innovation." Implemented "America's AI Action Plan" emphasizing deregulation over safety, with executive orders requiring federal AI procurement to be free from "ideological bias" while directing agencies to eliminate regulatory barriers to AI development

**Crisis Timing:**
Historical data compiled from multiple financial crises indicates that systemic breakdowns typically occur **8-12 years** after major deregulation initiatives begin, suggesting a predictable lag between policy changes and market consequences. With major deregulation beginning in 2017, this pattern suggests elevated crisis probability during 2025-2029.

## Phase 5: Crisis and System Breakdown (1-2 years)

**Characteristics:**
- Financial system breakdown requiring massive government intervention
- Widespread recognition that deregulation contributed to crisis severity
- Political backlash against deregulation advocates
- Cycle resets to Phase 1 with new crisis-driven re-regulation

**Academic Framework:**
Research demonstrates "consistent evidence of pro-cyclical regulatory policies by governments" across "ten of the most infamous financial booms and busts since the 18th century", indicating this pattern represents a structural feature of democratic financial policy-making rather than isolated incidents.

## Theoretical Underpinnings

### Political Economy Model:
Recent theoretical work shows that "inefficient regulatory cycles can naturally arise when electoral concerns are introduced into a simple model of financial intermediation", providing formal economic explanation for the observed historical patterns.

### Pro-cyclical Regulation Mechanism:
The academic literature identifies that "electoral concerns amplify the influence of public opinion on policy, leading to ex ante inefficient pro-cyclicality in financial regulation", explaining why democratic systems consistently produce regulations that move in the wrong direction relative to financial stability needs.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Current Cycle Position (2025):
- **15 years** since Dodd-Frank enactment (2010) - late Phase 2/early Phase 3
- **8 years** since Trump deregulation initiatives began (2017) - Phase 4
- **Pattern Implication**: Historical precedent suggests transition to Phase 5 (Crisis) within 2-4 years

### Policy Implications:
Understanding these cycles provides framework for anticipating regulatory policy changes and assessing systemic financial risks based on current phase positioning within the established 20-30 year pattern.
