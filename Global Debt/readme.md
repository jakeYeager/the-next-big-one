## Project Information
**Project Name**: Debt & Leverage Crisis Analysis Enhancement with Academic References  
**Project Type**: Financial Crisis Analysis Document Enhancement  
**Date & Time**: Saturday, August 23, 2025  
**Claude AI Version**: Claude Sonnet 4

**Specific Requirements**:
- Maintain original analytical framework and practical insights
- Add peer-reviewed academic research and citations
- Preserve core themes: D-7 debt crisis, Minsky Moment analysis, leverage amplification mechanisms
- Include comprehensive references section with proper academic formatting
- Enhance credibility while retaining compelling narrative structure

   - Original analysis framework
   - Historical crisis patterns (1987, S&L, 2008, European debt crisis)
   - Current risk assessment and Minsky Moment analysis
   - Investment implications and conclusions

2. **Enhanced Debt & Leverage Crisis Analysis with Academic References.md** (Secondary reference)
   - Previously enhanced version with academic citations
   - Comprehensive reference section
   - Academic framework integration
